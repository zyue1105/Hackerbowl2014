For example, if given a target value of 150 and a list of numbers to pick from consisting of 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 100, 22 and 28 because 100 + 22 + 28 =150. If given a target value of 30 and the sample numbers to pick from were 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 28 and 2 because 28 + 2 = 30. NOTE: Once you use a number from the list you cannot pick it again. NOTE: If no combination of numbers adds up to the requested value, the correct answer is \"No combination matches\". NOTE: There can be more than one correct answer. For example, for target value 3 and list 1, 2 and 3 the correct answer would be either: 1, 2 or 3. You only need to return 1 correct answer not all of them. Write a program that takes a list of numbers from the command line. The first number is the target value and the reminder of the numbers (however many there may be) is the set of numbers you have to pick from. The program should either output a subset whose sum equals the target or \"No combination matches\" if no such subset exists.

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ??

For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647]. Complexity: expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N)); expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.","answerCount":11,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5955807912919040","name":"Question #70","votes":1},{"title":"Suppose you are given one number decomposed in binary representation.

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ??

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

Output:  Single integer - the minimum number of elements to be removed from the array.  Sample Test Case:  Input: {4,5,3,8,3,7}  Output: 2  Note: In the above sample you can remove the fourth and the sixth measurement results (values 8 and 7). Then the maximum of the remaining values will be 5, and the minimum one will be 3. Or else, you can remove the third and fifth results (both equal 3). After that the largest remaining result will be 8, and the smallest one will be 4.  You do not need to write full code. Just fill out the given function.","answerCount":11,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=4532415284379648","name":"Question #77","votes":0},{"title":"Integer V lies strictly between integers U and W if U < V < W or if U > V > W. A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647]. Complexity: expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N)); expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Output:  Single integer - the minimum number of elements to be removed from the array.  Sample Test Case:  Input: {4,5,3,8,3,7}  Output: 2  Note: In the above sample you can remove the fourth and the sixth measurement results (values 8 and 7). Then the maximum of the remaining values will be 5, and the minimum one will be 3. Or else, you can remove the third and fifth results (both equal 3). After that the largest remaining result will be 8, and the smallest one will be 4.  You do not need to write full code. Just fill out the given function.","answerCount":11,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=4532415284379648","name":"Question #75","votes":0},{"title":"Integer V lies strictly between integers U and W if U < V < W or if U > V > W. A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647]. Complexity: expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N)); expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.","answerCount":11,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5955807912919040","name":"Question #76","votes":1},{"title":"Suppose you are given one number decomposed in binary representation.

If the digit is 4 then you have to print \"Hacker\" else you have to print \"Earth\".  Input: first line contain number of test cases T , next T line contain a single interger n.  Output: For each test case print \"Hacker\"(without quotes) if nth digit of lucky string is \"4\" else print \"Earth\"(without quotes) if nth digit of lucky string is \"5\".

For example, if given a target value of 150 and a list of numbers to pick from consisting of 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 100, 22 and 28 because 100 + 22 + 28 =150. If given a target value of 30 and the sample numbers to pick from were 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 28 and 2 because 28 + 2 = 30. NOTE: Once you use a number from the list you cannot pick it again. NOTE: If no combination of numbers adds up to the requested value, the correct answer is \"No combination matches\". NOTE: There can be more than one correct answer. For example, for target value 3 and list 1, 2 and 3 the correct answer would be either: 1, 2 or 3. You only need to return 1 correct answer not all of them. Write a program that takes a list of numbers from the command line. The first number is the target value and the reminder of the numbers (however many there may be) is the set of numbers you have to pick from. The program should either output a subset whose sum equals the target or \"No combination matches\" if no such subset exists. We would prefer you use Java or C# on this program, but you can use another procedural language if you don't know Java or C#. For example, the following inputs should yield the following results: SubsetSum 15 1 2 3 5 7 10 {3,7,5} SubsetSum 9 1 2 3 5 7 10 {2,7} SubsetSum 100 1 2 3 5 7 10 No combination matches","answerCount":14,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5394117727092736","name":"Question #56","votes":0},{"title":"Write a function that converts an int into its alpha-numeric equivalent represented as a null terminated string.

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

One hashtable userName as key and url sequence as value, where url sequence is three url contatenated by a special character like '#' (google#amazon#yahoo). This value is in FIFO manner. For each value, we check with the second hashtable and see if they exist before, if yes, increment the count, if no, insert the new sequence with count set to 0.
