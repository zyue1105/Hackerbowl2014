For example, if given a target value of 150 and a list of numbers to pick from consisting of 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 100, 22 and 28 because 100 + 22 + 28 =150. If given a target value of 30 and the sample numbers to pick from were 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 28 and 2 because 28 + 2 = 30. NOTE: Once you use a number from the list you cannot pick it again. NOTE: If no combination of numbers adds up to the requested value, the correct answer is \"No combination matches\". NOTE: There can be more than one correct answer. For example, for target value 3 and list 1, 2 and 3 the correct answer would be either: 1, 2 or 3. You only need to return 1 correct answer not all of them. Write a program that takes a list of numbers from the command line. The first number is the target value and the reminder of the numbers (however many there may be) is the set of numbers you have to pick from. The program should either output a subset whose sum equals the target or \"No combination matches\" if no such subset exists.

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

Now we concatenate all the lucky numbers (in ascending order) to make a lucky string \"4544455455444445454455...\"  Given n, your task is to find the nth digit of the lucky string. If the digit is 4 then you have to print \"Hacker\" else you have to print \"Earth\".  Input: first line contain number of test cases T , next T line contain a single interger n.  Output: For each test case print \"Hacker\"(without quotes) if nth digit of lucky string is \"4\" else print \"Earth\"(without quotes) if nth digit of lucky string is \"5\".

For example, if given a target value of 150 and a list of numbers to pick from consisting of 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 100, 22 and 28 because 100 + 22 + 28 =150. If given a target value of 30 and the sample numbers to pick from were 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 28 and 2 because 28 + 2 = 30. NOTE: Once you use a number from the list you cannot pick it again. NOTE: If no combination of numbers adds up to the requested value, the correct answer is \"No combination matches\". NOTE: There can be more than one correct answer. For example, for target value 3 and list 1, 2 and 3 the correct answer would be either: 1, 2 or 3. You only need to return 1 correct answer not all of them. Write a program that takes a list of numbers from the command line. The first number is the target value and the reminder of the numbers (however many there may be) is the set of numbers you have to pick from. The program should either output a subset whose sum equals the target or \"No combination matches\" if no such subset exists. We would prefer you use Java or C# on this program, but you can use another procedural language if you don't know Java or C#. For example, the following inputs should yield the following results: SubsetSum 15 1 2 3 5 7 10 {3,7,5} SubsetSum 9 1 2 3 5 7 10 {2,7} SubsetSum 100 1 2 3 5 7 10 No combination matches","answerCount":14,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5394117727092736","name":"Question #44","votes":0},{"title":"Write a function that converts an int into its alpha-numeric equivalent represented as a null terminated string.

One hashtable userName as key and url sequence as value, where url sequence is three url contatenated by a special character like '#' (google#amazon#yahoo). This value is in FIFO manner. For each value, we check with the second hashtable and see if they exist before, if yes, increment the count, if no, insert the new sequence with count set to 0.

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

For example, if given a target value of 150 and a list of numbers to pick from consisting of 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 100, 22 and 28 because 100 + 22 + 28 =150. If given a target value of 30 and the sample numbers to pick from were 1, 2, 100, 22 and 28, the correct answer would be 28 and 2 because 28 + 2 = 30. NOTE: Once you use a number from the list you cannot pick it again. NOTE: If no combination of numbers adds up to the requested value, the correct answer is \"No combination matches\". NOTE: There can be more than one correct answer. For example, for target value 3 and list 1, 2 and 3 the correct answer would be either: 1, 2 or 3.

NOTE: There can be more than one correct answer. For example, for target value 3 and list 1, 2 and 3 the correct answer would be either: 1, 2 or 3. You only need to return 1 correct answer not all of them. Write a program that takes a list of numbers from the command line. The first number is the target value and the reminder of the numbers (however many there may be) is the set of numbers you have to pick from. The program should either output a subset whose sum equals the target or \"No combination matches\" if no such subset exists. We would prefer you use Java or C# on this program, but you can use another procedural language if you don't know Java or C#. For example, the following inputs should yield the following results: SubsetSum 15 1 2 3 5 7 10 {3,7,5} SubsetSum 9 1 2 3 5 7 10 {2,7} SubsetSum 100 1 2 3 5 7 10 No combination matches","answerCount":14,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5394117727092736","name":"Question #55","votes":0},{"title":"Write a function that converts an int into its alpha-numeric equivalent represented as a null terminated string.

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists.

So, we add the five 0's that were left.","answerCount":10,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5115222951985152","name":"Question #87","votes":0},{"title":"An integer array contains elements in increasing order till some point and then decreasing order , return  the index of maximum number.

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0. For example, the distance between indices 4 and 5 is 1 because abs(4 ? 5) = (5 ? 4) = 1. Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist. For example, given array A such that:   A[0] = 1    A[1] = 4    A[2] = 7   A[3] = 3    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 5 the function should return 2 because: indices 1 and 3 are adjacent because A[1] ?? A[3] and the array does not contain any value that lies strictly between A[1] = 4 and A[3] = 3; the distance between these indices is abs(1 ? 3) = 2; no other pair of adjacent indices that has a smaller distance exists. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [?2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of indices (P, Q) where 0 ?? P < Q < N is said to have adjacent values if no value in the array lies strictly between values A[P] and A[Q], and in addition A[P] ?? A[Q]. For example, in array A such that:   A[0] = 0    A[1] = 3    A[2] = 3   A[3] = 7    A[4] = 5    A[5] = 3   A[6] = 11   A[7] = 1 the following pairs of indices have adjacent values:   (0, 7),   (1, 4),   (1, 7),   (2, 4),   (2, 7),   (3, 4),   (3, 6),   (4, 5),   (5, 7). For example, indices 4 and 5 have adjacent values because the values A[4] = 5 and A[5] = 3 are different, and there is no value in array A that lies strictly between them ? the only such value could be the number 4, which is not present in the array. Given two indices P and Q, their distance is defined as abs(P?Q), where abs(X) = X for X ?? 0, and abs(X) = ?X for X < 0.

Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); } that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return ?1 if no adjacent indices exist.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.  Assume that:  N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1]. Complexity:  expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.  function solution(A) {     var n = A.length;     var result = 0;     for (var i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {         if (A[i] == A[i + 1])             result = result + 1;     }     var r = 0;     for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {         var count = 0;         if (i > 0) {             if (A[i - 1] != A[i])                 count = count + 1;             else                 count = count - 1;         }         if (i < n - 1) {             if (A[i + 1] != A[i])                 count = count + 1;             else                 count = count - 1;         }         r = Math.max(r, count);     }     return result + r; }","answerCount":20,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5675246111686656","name":"Question #87","votes":-1},{"title":"Find numbers which are palindromic in both their decimal and octal representations","answerCount":20,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=4653430970777600","name":"Question #88","votes":1},{"title":"Given N strings, find the smallest string in lexicographic order which contains all the given strings as subsequences","answerCount":20,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5116085787426816","name":"Question #89","votes":0},{"title":"Given a screen with all pixels having one of two colors.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\".

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.  Assume that:  N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1].

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.  Assume that:  N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1]. Complexity:  expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.  function solution(A) {     var n = A.length;     var result = 0;     for (var i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {         if (A[i] == A[i + 1])             result = result + 1;     }     var r = 0;     for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {         var count = 0;         if (i > 0) {             if (A[i - 1] != A[i])                 count = count + 1;             else                 count = count - 1;         }         if (i < n - 1) {             if (A[i + 1] != A[i])                 count = count + 1;             else                 count = count - 1;         }         r = Math.max(r, count);     }     return result + r; }","answerCount":20,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5675246111686656","name":"Question #104","votes":-1},{"title":"Find numbers which are palindromic in both their decimal and octal representations","answerCount":20,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=4653430970777600","name":"Question #105","votes":1},{"title":"Given N strings, find the smallest string in lexicographic order which contains all the given strings as subsequences","answerCount":20,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5116085787426816","name":"Question #106","votes":0},{"title":"Given a screen with all pixels having one of two colors.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.

Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime.

Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets. For the first data set (5 points) - 1 For the second data set (10 points) - 1 For the third data set (15 points) - 1","answerCount":23,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=6662415412363264","name":"Question #72","votes":2},{"title":"Given 7 letter tiles and a dictionary of valid words, return the set of words that can be generated using 1-7 of those tiles.

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.

For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets. For the first data set (5 points) - 1 For the second data set (10 points) - 1 For the third data set (15 points) - 1","answerCount":23,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=6662415412363264","name":"Question #73","votes":2},{"title":"Given 7 letter tiles and a dictionary of valid words, return the set of words that can be generated using 1-7 of those tiles.

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.

Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = \"011\". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets.

Each coin is showing either heads or tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins showing the same face.  You are given an implementation of a function:  function solution(A);  that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the coins, returns the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed). Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array A contains only 0s and\/or 1s:  0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1 represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting of six numbers, such that:    A[0] = 1     A[1] = 1     A[2] = 0   A[3] = 1     A[4] = 0     A[5] = 0 the function returns 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1) and (4, 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2] the adjacency equals 4, as there are four pairs of adjacent coins showing the same face, namely (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher adjacency.  Unfortunately, there is a bug in the implementation. Find it and correct it. You should modify at most two lines of code.

Each balance weighs ten pounds and is  considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are   exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed   some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.  There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.  The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... Each pair of lines is formatted as follows:  WL  WR   WL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively.   is a space-delimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance.    may contain zero or more elements.

Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.  The output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows:  :    So the output for this problem would be:  0: 0 14 1: 10 0 2: 0 3 3: 0 0","answerCount":34,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=12150672","name":"Question #19","votes":0},{"title":"\/\/ cat, actor -> T \n\/\/ car, actor -> F \n \nbool anaStrStr (string needle, string haystack)  \n{ \n}","answerCount":33,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5671785349513216","name":"Question #20","votes":0},{"title":"Given a unordered array of numbers, remove the fewest number of numbers to produce the longest ordered sequence.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.

Each balance weighs ten pounds and is  considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are   exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed   some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.  There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.  The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... Each pair of lines is formatted as follows:  WL  WR   WL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively.   is a space-delimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance.    may contain zero or more elements.

Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.  The output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows:  :    So the output for this problem would be:  0: 0 14 1: 10 0 2: 0 3 3: 0 0","answerCount":34,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=12150672","name":"Question #38","votes":0},{"title":"\/\/ cat, actor -> T \n\/\/ car, actor -> F \n \nbool anaStrStr (string needle, string haystack)  \n{ \n}","answerCount":33,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5671785349513216","name":"Question #39","votes":0},{"title":"Given a unordered array of numbers, remove the fewest number of numbers to produce the longest ordered sequence.

Question is as follows.  You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.      You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.      You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:                         41111921111119                         11119   11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.  Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 60 \/ 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)\/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 63 \/ 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15501897","name":"Question #84","votes":-1},{"title":"write a program to print the given string as alphabets in order next integres fallowed by sum  example: CAE2W3A is input and output should be  ACDEW5","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=13382661","name":"Question #85","votes":0},{"title":"Alex is standing on the top left cell (1,1) of a n*m table.

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.

In the beginning, first player decides a secret key, which is a sequence (s1,s2,...sk) where 0 < si <= n, Then second player makes guesses in rounds, where each guess is of form (g1,g2, ...gk), and after each guess first player calculates the score for the guess. Score for a guess is equal to number of i's for which we have gi = si.  For example if the secret key is (4,2,5,3,1) and the guess is (1,2,3,7,1),then the score is 2, because g2 = s2 and g5 = s5.   Given a sequence of guesses, and scores for each guess, your program must decide if there exists at least one secret key that generates those exact scores.  Input  First line of input contains a single integer C (1 <=C <= 100). C test-cases follow. First line of each test-case contains three integers n,k and q. (1 <=n,k <=11, 1<=q<=8).

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).   Example Input:  100 GAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT CACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG 8 43  70  27 3   18  24 65  99  45 20  39  26 45  74  26 10  28  20 78  97  23 0   9   22    Output Specification  Print to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline. The total score is simply the sum of the scores of the gene predictions included in your final result.   When constructing your output, you may only consider genes exactly as they are described in the input. If you find the contents of a gene replicated elsewhere in the DNA string, you are not allowed to treat the second copy as a viable gene. Your solution must be fast and efficient to be considered correct by the robot.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.   Example output:  1 2,3,4 2 1,3,4 3 1,2,4 4 1,2,3 5 4,3,1","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=9670311","name":"Question #176","votes":0},{"title":"Write atof in Java, which converts a string representation of a float (like \"342.18E-10\") to an actual float without using any built-in parsing functions.","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=4901629824335872","name":"Question #177","votes":2},{"title":"consider a B2C website like Amazon, which will receive thousands requests from buyer per minutes.

Each balance weighs ten pounds and is  considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are   exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed   some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.  There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.  The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... Each pair of lines is formatted as follows:  WL  WR   WL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively.   is a space-delimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance.    may contain zero or more elements.  Consider the following input:  4 0 1 0 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 0  Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side and balance 2 on its right side Balance 1 has balance 3 on its right side Balance 2 has three pounds on its left side Balance 3 has nothing on it  Since balance 3 has nothing on it it is already perfectly balanced, and weighs a total of 10 pounds. Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.  The output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows:  :    So the output for this problem would be:  0: 0 14 1: 10 0 2: 0 3 3: 0 0","answerCount":34,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=12150672","name":"Question #4","votes":0},{"title":"Check if a given tree is a valid BST","answerCount":31,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5632735657852928","name":"Question #5","votes":0},{"title":"Determine the 10 most frequent words given a terabyte of strings.","answerCount":28,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=14548838","name":"Question #6","votes":0},{"title":"Find the minimum depth of a binary tree","answerCount":28,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=6913773","name":"Question #7","votes":0},{"title":"Sink Zero in Binary Tree.

Guys finding the shortest path is easy. But how can I make the algo so fast that even if I remove one of the edges my algo should still be very fast. O(n log n) or  faster. Remember we are not deleting the edges permanently. We are just temporary removing one edge per case. In each case only one edge is removed. Suppose we blocked one edge E in one case. We have to find the shortest path for the graph. In next case, we will reconnect the last edge and we will block\/remove a new edge. And again for this new case we have to find the shortest path.  Another way of understanding the problem is suppose there are cities connected to each other. And every day one of the roads gets blocked because of heavy rain. what is the shortest path every day from city s to e. Also one more important thing to note that each road can be used only once.

Goal: come up with a divide-and-conquer pseudocode to solve the general problem in O(n(logn)^2) time.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.   Example output:  1 2,3,4 2 1,3,4 3 1,2,4 4 1,2,3 5 4,3,1","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=9670311","name":"Question #40","votes":0},{"title":"Design a system for showing quotes on the web?

Each peg can hold discs in decreasing order of radius when looked from bottom to top of the peg. There are N discs which have radius 1 to N; Given the initial configuration of the pegs and the final configuration of the pegs, output the moves required to transform from the initial to final configuration. You are required to do the transformations in minimal number of moves.      A move consists of picking the topmost disc of any one of the pegs and placing it on top of anyother peg.     At anypoint of time, the decreasing radius property of all the pegs must be maintained.   Constraints: 1<= N<=8 3<= K<=5   Input Format: N K 2nd line contains N integers. Each integer in the second line is in the range 1 to K where the i-th integer denotes the peg to which disc of radius i is present in the initial configuration. 3rd line denotes the final configuration in a format similar to the initial configuration.   Output Format: The first line contains M - The minimal number of moves required to complete the transformation. The following M lines describe a move, by a peg number to pick from and a peg number to place on. If there are more than one solutions, it's sufficient to output any one of them.

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).   Example Input:  100 GAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT CACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG 8 43  70  27 3   18  24 65  99  45 20  39  26 45  74  26 10  28  20 78  97  23 0   9   22    Output Specification  Print to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline. The total score is simply the sum of the scores of the gene predictions included in your final result.   When constructing your output, you may only consider genes exactly as they are described in the input.

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.

Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.   Example output:  1 2,3,4 2 1,3,4 3 1,2,4 4 1,2,3 5 4,3,1","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=9670311","name":"Question #158","votes":0},{"title":"Tell me about a recent bug you tracked down and how you did it.","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=56927","name":"Question #159","votes":0},{"title":"consider a B2C website like Amazon, which will receive thousands requests from buyer per minutes.

Question is as follows.  You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.      You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.      You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:                         41111921111119                         11119   11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.  Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 60 \/ 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)\/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 63 \/ 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15501897","name":"Question #84","votes":-1},{"title":"write a program to print the given string as alphabets in order next integres fallowed by sum  example: CAE2W3A is input and output should be  ACDEW5","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=13382661","name":"Question #85","votes":0},{"title":"Alex is standing on the top left cell (1,1) of a n*m table.

Each rectangle denoted by bottom left & top right corner coordinates. 2) set P of n2 points - let n = n1 + n2  For each point 'p' in set P, find the rectangle 'r_p' in set R that contains 'p'. If 'p' is not enclosed by any rectangle, then 'r_p' is undefined. Otherwise, 'r_p' is unique because of the non-overlapping set.  Goal: come up with a divide-and-conquer pseudocode to solve the general problem in O(n(logn)^2) time.   Asked about points that are on the edge of the rectangle, and they said it was up to me whether to include those or not, just a matter of \"<\" vs \"<=\", etc. comparisons. Because it's just pseudocode they were looking for, they were not too concerned with the actual structure of the return value, just that the D&C algorithm showed the logic.  Struggled with it for awhile and they simplified the problem to a ~special case with the constraint where all rectangles of R intersected a horizontal line 'L', and instead give a O(nlogn) algorithm to solve the same problem. I suspect this would've been a subproblem\/subroutine of the more general case, but again got a bit lost.","answerCount":20,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15443800","name":"Question #87","votes":5},{"title":"FB has decided to award user who submits the billionth search query on a given day a car, by showing them a banner on their search result page.

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.   Example input file: 1250 LJS93K       1300       10500 J38ZZ9       700        4750 HJ394L      200        3250 O1IE82      75         10250    Output specifications  Your boss is not interested in exactly what you ejected to save the plane, he\/she is currently only interested in how much it will cost the company. Your program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing, and minimize company losses. It should print out the total value of goods lost as a plain integer, followed by a newline. Do not insert commas or dollar signs.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.

Guys finding the shortest path is easy. But how can I make the algo so fast that even if I remove one of the edges my algo should still be very fast. O(n log n) or  faster. Remember we are not deleting the edges permanently. We are just temporary removing one edge per case. In each case only one edge is removed. Suppose we blocked one edge E in one case. We have to find the shortest path for the graph. In next case, we will reconnect the last edge and we will block\/remove a new edge. And again for this new case we have to find the shortest path.  Another way of understanding the problem is suppose there are cities connected to each other. And every day one of the roads gets blocked because of heavy rain. what is the shortest path every day from city s to e. Also one more important thing to note that each road can be used only once.

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.   Example input file: 1250 LJS93K       1300       10500 J38ZZ9       700        4750 HJ394L      200        3250 O1IE82      75         10250    Output specifications  Your boss is not interested in exactly what you ejected to save the plane, he\/she is currently only interested in how much it will cost the company. Your program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing, and minimize company losses.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.   Example output:  1 2,3,4 2 1,3,4 3 1,2,4 4 1,2,3 5 4,3,1","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=9670311","name":"Question #148","votes":0},{"title":"Tell me about a recent bug you tracked down and how you did it.","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=56927","name":"Question #149","votes":0},{"title":"consider a B2C website like Amazon, which will receive thousands requests from buyer per minutes.

You are required to do the transformations in minimal number of moves.      A move consists of picking the topmost disc of any one of the pegs and placing it on top of anyother peg.     At anypoint of time, the decreasing radius property of all the pegs must be maintained.   Constraints: 1<= N<=8 3<= K<=5   Input Format: N K 2nd line contains N integers. Each integer in the second line is in the range 1 to K where the i-th integer denotes the peg to which disc of radius i is present in the initial configuration. 3rd line denotes the final configuration in a format similar to the initial configuration.   Output Format: The first line contains M - The minimal number of moves required to complete the transformation. The following M lines describe a move, by a peg number to pick from and a peg number to place on. If there are more than one solutions, it's sufficient to output any one of them.

You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

Each balance weighs ten pounds and is  considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are   exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed   some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.  There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.  The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc...

Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.

Question is as follows.  You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.      You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.      You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:                         41111921111119                         11119   11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.  Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 60 \/ 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)\/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 63 \/ 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15501897","name":"Question #82","votes":-1},{"title":"write a program to print the given string as alphabets in order next integres fallowed by sum  example: CAE2W3A is input and output should be  ACDEW5","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=13382661","name":"Question #83","votes":0},{"title":"Alex is standing on the top left cell (1,1) of a n*m table.

The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.   Example input file: 1250 LJS93K       1300       10500 J38ZZ9       700        4750 HJ394L      200        3250 O1IE82      75         10250    Output specifications  Your boss is not interested in exactly what you ejected to save the plane, he\/she is currently only interested in how much it will cost the company. Your program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing, and minimize company losses. It should print out the total value of goods lost as a plain integer, followed by a newline. Do not insert commas or dollar signs.   Example output (newline after integer): 9500","answerCount":18,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=134810","name":"Question #97","votes":0},{"title":"Write a function that accepts two or more strings and returns the longest common substring in all of them.","answerCount":18,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=16381662","name":"Question #98","votes":4},{"title":"given a set of distinct integers {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, ...} and a set of exclusion rules: R = {{a1, a3}, {a2, a4, a10}, ...} can you print out all the valid subsets?

Score for a guess is equal to number of i's for which we have gi = si.  For example if the secret key is (4,2,5,3,1) and the guess is (1,2,3,7,1),then the score is 2, because g2 = s2 and g5 = s5.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.   Example output:  6.00","answerCount":8,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=9672248","name":"Question #158","votes":0},{"title":"Question: Design a component that implements the following functionality..  1) Record an Event (For the sake of simplicity, treat the Event as an integer code)   2) Return the number of Events recorded in the last one minute.   3) Return the number of Events recorded in the last one hour. i.e implement the following interface  - Design the interface first - Give the implementation detail.  <<>>  Open ended question: What if there isn't enough storage available to store each individual event ?","answerCount":8,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=9381092","name":"Question #159","votes":0},{"title":"Write a program to reverse a string and use it as a subroutine to reverse each word in a line","answerCount":8,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=83753","name":"Question #160","votes":0},{"title":"Write a recursive procedure, called laceStringsRecur(s1, s2), which also laces together two strings.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.

Each balance weighs ten pounds and is  considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are   exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed   some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.  There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.  The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... Each pair of lines is formatted as follows:  WL  WR   WL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively.   is a space-delimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance.    may contain zero or more elements.

Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.  The output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows:  :    So the output for this problem would be:  0: 0 14 1: 10 0 2: 0 3 3: 0 0","answerCount":34,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=12150672","name":"Question #38","votes":0},{"title":"\/\/ cat, actor -> T \n\/\/ car, actor -> F \n \nbool anaStrStr (string needle, string haystack)  \n{ \n}","answerCount":33,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5671785349513216","name":"Question #39","votes":0},{"title":"Given a unordered array of numbers, remove the fewest number of numbers to produce the longest ordered sequence.

Guys finding the shortest path is easy. But how can I make the algo so fast that even if I remove one of the edges my algo should still be very fast. O(n log n) or  faster. Remember we are not deleting the edges permanently. We are just temporary removing one edge per case. In each case only one edge is removed. Suppose we blocked one edge E in one case. We have to find the shortest path for the graph. In next case, we will reconnect the last edge and we will block\/remove a new edge. And again for this new case we have to find the shortest path.

Question is as follows.  You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.      You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.      You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:                         41111921111119                         11119   11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.  Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 60 \/ 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)\/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 63 \/ 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15501897","name":"Question #84","votes":-1},{"title":"write a program to print the given string as alphabets in order next integres fallowed by sum  example: CAE2W3A is input and output should be  ACDEW5","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=13382661","name":"Question #85","votes":0},{"title":"Alex is standing on the top left cell (1,1) of a n*m table.

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.

Your program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing, and minimize company losses.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).   Example Input:  100 GAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT CACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG 8 43  70  27 3   18  24 65  99  45 20  39  26 45  74  26 10  28  20 78  97  23 0   9   22    Output Specification  Print to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline.

When constructing your output, you may only consider genes exactly as they are described in the input.

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.   Example output:  1 2,3,4 2 1,3,4 3 1,2,4 4 1,2,3 5 4,3,1","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=9670311","name":"Question #187","votes":0},{"title":"Tell me about a recent bug you tracked down and how you did it.","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=56927","name":"Question #188","votes":0},{"title":"Write atof in Java, which converts a string representation of a float (like \"342.18E-10\") to an actual float without using any built-in parsing functions.","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=4901629824335872","name":"Question #189","votes":2},{"title":"consider a B2C website like Amazon, which will receive thousands requests from buyer per minutes.

Each balance weighs ten pounds and is  considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are   exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed   some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.  There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.  The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... Each pair of lines is formatted as follows:  WL  WR   WL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively.   is a space-delimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance.    may contain zero or more elements.  Consider the following input:  4 0 1 0 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 0  Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side and balance 2 on its right side Balance 1 has balance 3 on its right side Balance 2 has three pounds on its left side Balance 3 has nothing on it  Since balance 3 has nothing on it it is already perfectly balanced, and weighs a total of 10 pounds. Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.  The output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows:  :    So the output for this problem would be:  0: 0 14 1: 10 0 2: 0 3 3: 0 0","answerCount":34,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=12150672","name":"Question #38","votes":0},{"title":"\/\/ cat, actor -> T \n\/\/ car, actor -> F \n \nbool anaStrStr (string needle, string haystack)  \n{ \n}","answerCount":33,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5671785349513216","name":"Question #39","votes":0},{"title":"Given a unordered array of numbers, remove the fewest number of numbers to produce the longest ordered sequence.

Constraints: 1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= K <= N <= 200 0 <= x_i <= 1000  Sample Input: 3 3 3 1 1 3 3 2 1 2 4 4 2 1 2 5 7  Sample Output: 0 1 3  Explanation:  For the first case, there is no need to move any object. For the second case, group objects 1 and 2 together by moving the first object to position 2. For the third case, group objects 1 and 2 together by moving the first object to position 2 and group objects 3 and 4 together by moving object 3 to position 7. Thus the answer is 1 + 2 = 3.","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=4804004722769920","name":"Question #85","votes":0},{"title":"This Question was asked in written round on one of the online coding round, The Question was to code this. Question is as follows.  You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.      You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.      You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:                         41111921111119                         11119   11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.  Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 60 \/ 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)\/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 63 \/ 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15501897","name":"Question #86","votes":-1},{"title":"write a program to print the given string as alphabets in order next integres fallowed by sum  example: CAE2W3A is input and output should be  ACDEW5","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=13382661","name":"Question #87","votes":0},{"title":"Alex is standing on the top left cell (1,1) of a n*m table.

Asked about points that are on the edge of the rectangle, and they said it was up to me whether to include those or not, just a matter of \"<\" vs \"<=\", etc. comparisons. Because it's just pseudocode they were looking for, they were not too concerned with the actual structure of the return value, just that the D&C algorithm showed the logic.  Struggled with it for awhile and they simplified the problem to a ~special case with the constraint where all rectangles of R intersected a horizontal line 'L', and instead give a O(nlogn) algorithm to solve the same problem.

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.   Example input file: 1250 LJS93K       1300       10500 J38ZZ9       700        4750 HJ394L      200        3250 O1IE82      75         10250    Output specifications  Your boss is not interested in exactly what you ejected to save the plane, he\/she is currently only interested in how much it will cost the company. Your program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing, and minimize company losses. It should print out the total value of goods lost as a plain integer, followed by a newline. Do not insert commas or dollar signs.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).   Example Input:  100 GAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT CACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG 8 43  70  27 3   18  24 65  99  45 20  39  26 45  74  26 10  28  20 78  97  23 0   9   22    Output Specification  Print to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline. The total score is simply the sum of the scores of the gene predictions included in your final result.   When constructing your output, you may only consider genes exactly as they are described in the input. If you find the contents of a gene replicated elsewhere in the DNA string, you are not allowed to treat the second copy as a viable gene. Your solution must be fast and efficient to be considered correct by the robot.

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane.

This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.   Example output:  1 2,3,4 2 1,3,4 3 1,2,4 4 1,2,3 5 4,3,1","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=9670311","name":"Question #189","votes":0},{"title":"Tell me about a recent bug you tracked down and how you did it.","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=56927","name":"Question #190","votes":0},{"title":"Write atof in Java, which converts a string representation of a float (like \"342.18E-10\") to an actual float without using any built-in parsing functions.","answerCount":3,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=4901629824335872","name":"Question #191","votes":2},{"title":"consider a B2C website like Amazon, which will receive thousands requests from buyer per minutes.

There are N discs which have radius 1 to N; Given the initial configuration of the pegs and the final configuration of the pegs, output the moves required to transform from the initial to final configuration. You are required to do the transformations in minimal number of moves.      A move consists of picking the topmost disc of any one of the pegs and placing it on top of anyother peg.     At anypoint of time, the decreasing radius property of all the pegs must be maintained.   Constraints: 1<= N<=8 3<= K<=5   Input Format: N K 2nd line contains N integers. Each integer in the second line is in the range 1 to K where the i-th integer denotes the peg to which disc of radius i is present in the initial configuration. 3rd line denotes the final configuration in a format similar to the initial configuration.   Output Format: The first line contains M - The minimal number of moves required to complete the transformation. The following M lines describe a move, by a peg number to pick from and a peg number to place on. If there are more than one solutions, it's sufficient to output any one of them. You can assume, there is always a solution with less than 7 moves and the initial confirguration will not be same as the final one.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).   Example Input:  100 GAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT CACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG 8 43  70  27 3   18  24 65  99  45 20  39  26 45  74  26 10  28  20 78  97  23 0   9   22    Output Specification  Print to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline. The total score is simply the sum of the scores of the gene predictions included in your final result.   When constructing your output, you may only consider genes exactly as they are described in the input. If you find the contents of a gene replicated elsewhere in the DNA string, you are not allowed to treat the second copy as a viable gene. Your solution must be fast and efficient to be considered correct by the robot.

Each balance weighs ten pounds and is  considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are   exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed   some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.  There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.  The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... Each pair of lines is formatted as follows:  WL  WR   WL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively.   is a space-delimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance.    may contain zero or more elements.

Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.  The output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows:  :    So the output for this problem would be:  0: 0 14 1: 10 0 2: 0 3 3: 0 0","answerCount":34,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=12150672","name":"Question #37","votes":0},{"title":"\/\/ cat, actor -> T \n\/\/ car, actor -> F \n \nbool anaStrStr (string needle, string haystack)  \n{ \n}","answerCount":33,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5671785349513216","name":"Question #38","votes":0},{"title":"Given a unordered array of numbers, remove the fewest number of numbers to produce the longest ordered sequence.

Question is as follows.  You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.      You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.      You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:                         41111921111119                         11119   11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.  Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 60 \/ 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)\/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 63 \/ 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15501897","name":"Question #83","votes":-1},{"title":"write a program to print the given string as alphabets in order next integres fallowed by sum  example: CAE2W3A is input and output should be  ACDEW5","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=13382661","name":"Question #84","votes":0},{"title":"Alex is standing on the top left cell (1,1) of a n*m table.

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).

When constructing your output, you may only consider genes exactly as they are described in the input.

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.

Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.

Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.

Question is as follows.  You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.      You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.      You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:                         41111921111119                         11119   11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.  Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 60 \/ 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)\/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 63 \/ 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15501897","name":"Question #84","votes":-1},{"title":"write a program to print the given string as alphabets in order next integres fallowed by sum  example: CAE2W3A is input and output should be  ACDEW5","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=13382661","name":"Question #85","votes":0},{"title":"Alex is standing on the top left cell (1,1) of a n*m table.

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.   Example input file: 1250 LJS93K       1300       10500 J38ZZ9       700        4750 HJ394L      200        3250 O1IE82      75         10250    Output specifications  Your boss is not interested in exactly what you ejected to save the plane, he\/she is currently only interested in how much it will cost the company. Your program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing, and minimize company losses. It should print out the total value of goods lost as a plain integer, followed by a newline. Do not insert commas or dollar signs.

Score for a guess is equal to number of i's for which we have gi = si.  For example if the secret key is (4,2,5,3,1) and the guess is (1,2,3,7,1),then the score is 2, because g2 = s2 and g5 = s5.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces. The list must be in order of proximity, with the closest of the three being first, and the farthest of the three being last.

Each balance weighs ten pounds and is  considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are   exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed   some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged   and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances  so that they are all perfectly balanced.  There may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.  The input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... Each pair of lines is formatted as follows:  WL  WR   WL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively.   is a space-delimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance.    may contain zero or more elements.  Consider the following input:  4 0 1 0 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 0  Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side and balance 2 on its right side Balance 1 has balance 3 on its right side Balance 2 has three pounds on its left side Balance 3 has nothing on it  Since balance 3 has nothing on it it is already perfectly balanced, and weighs a total of 10 pounds. Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side (30 pounds), and balance 2 on its right side (16 pounds), we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.  The output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as follows:  :    So the output for this problem would be:  0: 0 14 1: 10 0 2: 0 3 3: 0 0","answerCount":34,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=12150672","name":"Question #33","votes":0},{"title":"\/\/ cat, actor -> T \n\/\/ car, actor -> F \n \nbool anaStrStr (string needle, string haystack)  \n{ \n}","answerCount":33,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=5671785349513216","name":"Question #34","votes":0},{"title":"Given a unordered array of numbers, remove the fewest number of numbers to produce the longest ordered sequence.

Question is as follows.  You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.      You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.      You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:                         41111921111119                         11119   11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.  Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 60 \/ 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)\/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum \/ regular sum = 63 \/ 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=15501897","name":"Question #75","votes":-1},{"title":"write a program to print the given string as alphabets in order next integres fallowed by sum  example: CAE2W3A is input and output should be  ACDEW5","answerCount":21,"location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=13382661","name":"Question #76","votes":0},{"title":"As input, you are given two sets: 1) set R of n1 non-overlapping rectangles, whose sides are parallel to the x- and y-axes (ie: not rotated rectangles).

Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar situations.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally, your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.    Input specifications  The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash, followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight (in pounds). The format of these lines is:      SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed input files.

Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).

Since that whole relationship thing hasn't been working out for you recently, that loved one will have to be your cat, Sophie. Unfortunately you find yourself spending considerable time after you arrive home just trying to find her. Being a perfectionist and unable to let anything suboptimal be a part of your daily life, you decide to devise the most efficient possible method for finding Sophie.   Luckily for you, Sophie is a creature of habit. You know where all of her hiding places are, as well as the probability of her hiding in each one. You also know how long it takes you to walk from hiding place to hiding place. Write a program to determine the minimum expected time it will take to find Sophie in your apartment. It is sufficient to simply visit a location to check if Sophie is hiding there; no time must be spent looking for her at a location. Sophie is hiding when you enter your apartment, and then will not leave that hiding place until you find her. Your program must take the name of an input file as an argument on the command line.     Input Specifications  The input file starts with a single number, m, followed by a newline. m is the number of locations available for Sophie to hide in your apartment. This line is followed by m lines, each containing information for a single location of the form (brackets for clarity):    probability is the probability that Sophie is hiding in the location indicated. The sum of all the probabilities is always 1. The contents of these lines are separated by whitespace. Names will only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ('_'), and there will be no duplicate names. All input is guaranteed to be well-formed. Your starting point is the first location to be listed, and in effect it costs you no time to check if Sophie is there.   The file continues with a single number, c, followed by a newline. c is the number of connections that exist between the various locations. This line is followed by c lines, each of the form:       The first two entries are the names of locations and seconds is the number of seconds it takes you to walk between the them. Again these lines are whitespace-delimited. Note that the locations are unordered; you can walk between them in either direction and it will take the same amount of time. No duplicate pairs will be included in the input file, and all location names will match one described earlier in the file.   Example input file:  4 front_door    .2 in_cabinet    .3 under_bed     .4 behind_blinds .1 5 front_door under_bed     5 under_bed  behind_blinds 9 front_door behind_blinds 5 front_door in_cabinet    2 in_cabinet behind_blinds 6    Output Specifications  Your output must consist of a single number followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The number is the minimum expected time in seconds it takes to find Sophie, rounded to the nearest hundredth. Make sure that the number printed has exactly two digits after the decimal point (even if they are zeroes). If it is impossible to guarantee that you will find Sophie, print \"-1.00\" followed by a newline instead.

While traveling around town, visiting your friends, you realize it would be really handy to have a program that tells you which of your friends are closest based upon which friend you are currently visiting.   Being an engineer who is interested in writing software that is useful to everyone, you decide to write a general solution to your quandary. Each of your friends lives at a unique latitude and longitude. For the purposes of this program, the world is flat, and the latitude and longitude are for all intents and purposes Cartesian coordinates on a flat plane. For example, in our flat world, lat 45, long -179 is not as close to lat 45, long 179 when compared to lat 45, long 170.   Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name which contains the input data. Your program should output the nearest three other friends for each friend in the list. You are virtually a celebrity and your friend list can be astoundingly huge. Your program must exhibit better than quadratic asymptotic growth in runtime as a function of the size of your friend list, and be robust and resource efficient.     Input specifications  The input file consists of multiple lines, all of which follow the same format. Each line has three values separated by an amount of white space. The first value is the unique id number of that friend, expressed as an integer. The second value is the latitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. The third and last value is the longitude of that friend, expressed as a rational number. Every friend lives at a unique combination of latitude and longitude (e.g. no two friends will ever share the exact same values). Each line ends with a single new line, except for the last line of the file, which may or may not have a terminating new line.   Example input file:  1  0.0      0.0 2  10.1     -10.1 3  -12.2    12.2 4  38.3     38.3 5  79.99    179.99 You are guaranteed that your program will run against an input file that is well formed, and has at least four lines. You are also guaranteed that your list of friends have unique distances between one another; no two distinct pairs of friends will have the same distance between them.     Output specifications  In the order presented in the input file, output the nearest three friends for each friend. Each line of output should start with the integer id of the friend followed by a single space character, and then the list of three nearest other friend ids followed by a single new line. Even the last line of the output should terminate in a new line. This list should be comma-delimited, with no spaces.
