First of all we need to have the whole concept and context of pencil. 1) What kind of pencil is? regular paper pencil? blackboard pencil? indelible  pencil? or what kind?   then we should classify the test cases: Functionality testing  If it is a paper regular pencil I'd write a phrase in a piece of paper from my notebook. and I will check if the result were successful and satisfactory looking at the ink in the paper and check if it does not spot the paper with the hand pass. Since It is a good methodology to test positive, negative and regular values in a test ing process. check: speed of writing, sensibility with the paper. What about different type of paper, lets see thinner paper. What about non-white paper.  performance testing: how many words, papers, etc can I write with the ink of pencil.  stress testing what about if we make it write so fast? or so slow? or we push so hard on it?  scalability testing what about if we want to change the color of the ink?  Or we can make write thinner or vise versa.  Is it possible??  compatibility testing compatibility with  different king of paper or superfaces like ( glass, wood, plastic, etc.)  usability testing  who is going to use the pencil? old people? blind? child?  Is it easy to use? to handle?     safety testing is it toxic? is it fragile  and easy to break?  other test cases.  what about if the environment is too hot? or too cold?  what happed with the ink of the pencil? is still working?   I can still talking and talking about testing cases.  but the thing is that.  first of all you have to know the concept and context or what are you are going to test. second you have to know all the feature that the product, software or thing has.  then, ask to whoever is asking you to test.  What do you want me to test if they dont know then you can start doing it on your own?  then.. divide you types of testing ( performance, compatibility, usuability, etc.)  then test positives values, negatives values and regular values. test with the input it is suppose to work well and then test with the input that it is not suppose to work then test boundaries.  And if you are in an interview then... never stop taking about all the possibilities that can be in a testing process.  Note: I'm not a profesional tester, but Im getting ready to interview for MS for Testing!!!! so.. If Im wrong please feel free to comment on my comments!!!  hope it is helpful to people.
