Explain your answer in detail."},{"mm_name":"interview_question_comments","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","votes":"0","title":"This is a great problem. I really don't like (or perhaps don't fully comprehend) the answers given on this thread. Let's dig deeper on this one and explore:  Problem restatement: There exists an alphabet comprising some number of characters. The order of the alphabet, i.e. the full-ordering, is not known. You are given a list of \"words\" comprised of characters from the alphabet. The list of words is given to be sorted in lexicographical order. Write a program to deduce the order of the alphabet.  For the sake of example, let's assume that we're using an English alphabet (i.e. we know the full order). Now assume we have a set of words sorted in ascending lexicographical order:  aardvark ant bee cat cow dog horse llama sheep zebra  Given that we know the order of the English alphabet, it's easy to see that the list of animals comprising our input data is correctly sorted.  Now forget that you know anything at all about the English alphabet. Erase from your mind the fact that you know which characters comprise the alphabet (the problem statement doesn't bound the set of characters or make any guarantee that the set of words use all characters in the alphabet). Also, erase from your mind the fact that you know the order of the English alphabet.   Let's take the first word \"aardvark\". What does this tell us? It tells us that the characters \"a\", \"r\", \"d\", \"v\", and \"k\" are present in the alphabet. Does it provide any information that can be used to establish the order of these characters? NO! Remember that it's the order of the words in the list and thus comparisons between adjacent words in the list that provides clues about the order of the alphabet.  Okay, now let's look at the first and second words:  aardvark ant  What does this tell us? We see two new characters \"n\" and \"t\" by inspection of \"ant\". What's more we notice that the characters in the first column are both \"a\". So clearly the lexicographical ordering of these two words wasn't decided on the basis of the first column. Looking at the second column we note that the characters are different and correctly conclude that in our alphabet \"a\" proceeds \"n\".  How about the third column? Sorry, no more clues here. We know that the order of \"aardvark\" and \"ant\" was decided on the basis of the second column character and cannot deduce anything further by comparing the third column.  So on we go through the list of animal words... Below I've reproduced the lexicographically sorted list of words in the left column, and indicate the \"clues\" in the right column. For simplicity I'm not going to list new characters discovered in the alphabet but rather focus only on clues about the order of the characters in the alphabet.  Note that because you actually do know the order of the English alphabet, you can easily vet this information without doing insane mental gymnastics. Also note that by convention an order clue is indicated by an ordered pair representing an edge in a directed graph. For example (a,b) indicates a directed edge from tail vertex \"a\" to head vertex \"b\" indicating that \"a\" proceeds \"b\" in the alphabet.  aardvark       no order clues ant                (a,n) based on column 2 bee               (a,b) based on column 1 cat                (b,c) based on column 1 cow               (a,o) based on column 2 dog               (c,d) based on column 1 horse            (d,h) based on column 1 llama            (h,l) based on column 1 sheep           (l,s) based on column 1 zebra            (s,z) based on column 1    n   / a -> b -> c -> d -> h -> l -> s -> z   \\    o  Now remember that you know the order of the English alphabet and vet this graph. Makes sense right? For example we know that \"n\" comes after \"a\" as does \"b\" and \"o\". And clearly a -> b -> c -> d -> h -> l -> s -> z is correctly ordered.  Note that given our sorted list of animals we do not know the order of \"b\", \"n\" and \"o\". All we know is that they follow \"a\".  Also note that there are bunch of characters used in our list of animal words for which no clues were found. These are not show in the ASCII graph above. But these are really in the graph too (all with zero in-degree).  I seriously question the utility of doing a topological sort... It would produce a somewhat interesting result BUT is essentially meaningless except in the case that every vertex has out-degree one.  You could imagine a system that attempts to deduce ordering on an alphabet that exposes an interface DoesXProceedY(x, y) which returns YES, NO or KNOWN. Such a system could not (in general) use a topological sort of the graph to deduce the correct answer. Instead, it would need the graph topology.  Hope this helps."},{"mm_name":"interview_question_comments","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","votes":"0","title":"Graph creation:"},{"mm_name":"interview_question_comments","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","votes":"0","title":"why dont we use Tries here"},{"mm_name":"interview_question_comments","download_status":"UNPROCESSED","votes":"0","title":"c++ code here.. for constructing DAG from pair of consecutive two strings.

We let the number of winning for the first four teams be x, so they number of losing for them is (14-x). If the x is not large enough, we would find at least one team, let's say team 5, have the number of winning more than x. We need to avoid this happen. Let's assume the team 5 be our bottleneck and we let it has the winning as large as possible. We cannot ignore the last three teams at the same time. there are two matches between team 6 and team 7; two matches between team 7 and team 8, so there should be at least four winning time for team 6,7,8.

We know that whenever a new customer enters the room, she is going to find the biggest gap between any two old customers, divide it in half and sit right between them. So, to be really efficient about this we need to make sure that when she can easily divide at half at every stage. If you cannot perfectly divide a gap by 2, a seat is going to get wasted. And this needs to be done repeatedly. Therefore, at every point, we need to make sure that the length of the gaps between seats are powers of two. So, how should we start out? Well if we select 9 as the first person's seat: then the first gap is 9-1= 8 seats wide (power of 2). The second gap is 25-9= 16 seats wide (another power of 2).

I think I have an answer to this, but let me explain the way I'm thinking about it.So, first of all, we don't have a real buffer - that's the complication.  Our buffer can only store one character.--This problem reminded me of a problem from my algorithms class : \"How can you create a website hit counter that counts to 100,000 with only 2 digits (you don't need an exact count - an estimate is fine)?  Answer: Increment the count with probability 100/100000 = 0.1%. Multiply your count by 1000 to get your estimate.The point of the second problem is that it uses a probabilistic method.--Getting back to this problem... We only have a one character buffer, so that means that we have the following choice: do we want to keep the current character in the buffer, or swap it for the current character in the stream? Clearly, we must make this decision probabilistically.  But, with what probability do we keep the swap the character?Stream = A, B, C, D, E, ...n = length of streamP_n(A) = probability that A is our chosen character after we've read n characters from the stream.---As a first try, let's try swapping the character in our buffer with the current character with probability 1/2.This doesn't seem to make sense, however, because the last character will always have a 50% chance of being chosen, which can't be equal odds (do the math for 3 characters if you want).--Hmm, ok.  What if we change the probability based on how many characters we read?  If you think about it, we must have the odds of swapping get lower and lower, so that later character aren't favored.Well, let's work this out.If n = 2, we want all probabilities to be 1/2:P_2(A) = 1/2P_2(B) = 1/2So, P_2(swap) = 1/2.  Doesn't help us much.If n = 3, we want all probabilities to be 1/3:P_3(A) = P_2(A) * P_3(swap) = 1/2 * P_3(no swap) = 1/2 * (1 - P_3(swap)) = 1/3P_3(B) = P_2(B) * P_3(swap) = 1/2 * P_3(no swap) = 1/2 * (1 - P_3(swap)) = 1/3P_3(C) = P_3(swap) = 1/3So, if n = 3, P_3(swap) = 1/3.This suggests that we want P_n(swap) = 1/n, but we don't really know that until we've proven it.So, do this:1.

Why? because at the t+2we do not have e2 anymore, so the selection has to bedone between e1 and e3. In order to keep the overallprobabilities equal at the end of the sequence, we haveto weight P({ei}t+k) appropriately, otherwise they willnot be equal (as you  point out).

By the induction hypothesis, at time k, all elements have probability of 1/k.  Then at sample k+1, retain the new value with probability 1/(k+1).

If our buffer is an 8 bit char, that gives us an extra 4 bits to use as a counter.Of course that makes our counters max value 31, so if the stream has 32 characters, we'll reliably pick the very last one.  Would there be any huge problem with just keeping the counter at 31 once it gets there?But the 1/n probability wouldn't be even though, either way.
