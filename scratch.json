For example, if 'a' and 'c' are adjacent, they can replaced with 'b'. What is the smallest string which can result by applying this operation repeatedly?  Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each case contains the string you start with.  Output: Output T lines, one for each test case containing the smallest length of the resultant string after applying the operations optimally.  Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 The string will have at most 100 characters.  Sample Input: 3 cab bcab ccccc  Sample Output: 2 1 5  Explanation: For the first case, you can either get cab -> cc or cab -> bb, resulting in a string of length 2. For the second case, one optimal solution is: bcab -> aab -> ac -> b. No more operations can be applied and the resultant string has length 1. For the third case, no operations can be performed and so the answer is 5.",
