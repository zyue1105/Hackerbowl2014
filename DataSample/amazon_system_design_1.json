What data-structure has collisions and does not waste memory?  Answer-  an open hashtable.  The key can be whatever minimum interval you'd like to maintain for an appointment.  You can create the appointment object for each appointment and set the value for each time key you'd like the appointment to occupy.  A lookup on that time key would give you the pointer to the appointment and attempting to create an appointment in an allocated key would cause a collision.

You could make the 'Memo' class subscribe to a custom publisher that would invoke a specific method in the Memo class.  The publisher will have four lists. one for the year[as large your system needs], 1 for month[max size 12], 1 for date [max size 30], 1 for time [max size 24 'hours']. (you may want to split up the time list for minutes and hours). The lists will contain references ordered by the designation of the list.  The publisher will invoke an 'alarm' method in Memo depending on its subscription request.  The publisher instance will repeatedly request system time. First polling through the year list. If found a match then looking for the matched items in the months list then further through the days list and so on. Once you find a match you invoke the 'alarm' method for those instances of 'Memo's' .  The Memo class can then contain code to acquire information pertaining to that date and time.  The idea is that, no matter how many memos you have. you wouldn't need to cycle through all of them for every minute. You progressively cut down the size of the memos you need to  handle as you go through the lists. In addition since the lists are ordered, you don't need to iterate through the whole lists.
