Of particular interest is which intervals of the string represent individual genes. You have a number of \"gene predictions\", each of which assigns a score to an interval within the DNA string, and you want to find the subset of predictions such that the total score is maximized while avoiding overlaps. A gene prediction is a triple of the form (start, stop, score). start is the zero-based index of the first character in the DNA string contained in the gene. stop is the index of the last character contained in the gene. score is the score for the gene.     Input Specification  Your program will be passed the name of an input file on the command line. The contents of that file are as follows.   The first line of the input contains only n, the length of the DNA string you will be given.   The next ceiling(n \/ 80) lines each contain string of length 80 (or n % 80 for the last line) containing only the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Concatenate these lines to get the entire DNA strand.   The next line contains only g, the number of gene predictions you will be given.   The next g lines each contain a whitespace-delimited triple of integers of the form     representing a single gene prediction. No gene predictions will exceed the bounds of the DNA string or be malformed (start is non-negative and no more than stop, stop never exceeds n - 1).   Example Input:  100 GAACTATCGCCCGTGCGCATCGCCCGTCCGACCGGCCGTAAGTCTATCTCCCGAGCGGGCGCCCGATCTCAAGTGCACCT CACGGCCTCACGACCGTGAG 8 43  70  27 3   18  24 65  99  45 20  39  26 45  74  26 10  28  20 78  97  23 0   9   22    Output Specification  Print to standard out the score of the best possible subset of the gene predictions you are given such that no single index in the DNA string is contained in more than one gene prediction, followed by a newline.

For example, if 'a' and 'c' are adjacent, they can replaced with 'b'. What is the smallest string which can result by applying this operation repeatedly?  Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each case contains the string you start with.  Output: Output T lines, one for each test case containing the smallest length of the resultant string after applying the operations optimally.  Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 The string will have at most 100 characters.  Sample Input: 3 cab bcab ccccc  Sample Output: 2 1 5  Explanation: For the first case, you can either get cab -> cc or cab -> bb, resulting in a string of length 2. For the second case, one optimal solution is: bcab -> aab -> ac -> b. No more operations can be applied and the resultant string has length 1. For the third case, no operations can be performed and so the answer is 5.","location":"http:\/\/www.careercup.com\/question?id=12718665","name":"Question #1","votes":0,"size":86},{"title":"Given an array, find all unique three-member subsets, with unique being that [0,2,3] and [3,2,0] are the same set.
